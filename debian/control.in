Package: libassimp1
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends}
Description: 3D model import library
 Assimp is a library to import various well-known 3D model formats ("assets") in
 a uniform manner.
 Assimp aims at providing a full asset conversion pipeline for use in game
 engines / realtime rendering systems of any kind but is not limited to this
 audience.
 .
 The library is designed for maximum stability and flexibility. While written in
 C++, a pure C API exists, as well as bindings to various other languages,
 including Python, D and Blitzmax. Assimp loads models into a straightforward
 data structure for easy processing by your application. Various post processing
 steps (such as general optimization or computation of extra data like normal or
 tangent vectors) can be executed on the imported data to suit your needs.
 .
 This package provides the shared object necessary to run an application
 using Assimp.
