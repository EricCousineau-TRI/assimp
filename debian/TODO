dfsg-repacking:
 Q: I'm wondering whether it would make sense to remove other cruft as well -
    basically contrib/ entirely and workspaces could go as well.
 A: removed loads of stuff (though not workspaces/ nor all of contrib/)

version:
 Q: I think +dfsg would be preferable over ~dfsg, but you might have good
    reasons for your choice?
 A: did that (sa it was easiest when re-packaging a new DFSG)

debian/libassimp2.symbols file
 Q: Please consider using the c++ tag after having applied c++filt; see several
    recent threads on debian-mentors, e.g.,
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2011/07/msg00632.html
 A: done (note that there are both C++ (prettyfied) and C (leftalone) symbols
 
FTBFS:
 Q: dpkg-source -b assimp-2.0.863~dfsg
    dpkg-source: info: using source format `3.0 (quilt)'
    dpkg-source: info: building assimp using existing
    ./assimp_2.0.863~dfsg.orig.tar.gz
    dpkg-source: error: unwanted binary file: debian/copyright_hints
    dpkg-source: error: detected 1 unwanted binary file (add it in
    debian/source/include-binaries to allow its inclusion).
 A: due to the new dfsg-package, i got rid of most files that reported as false
    positives; the rest has been excluded from licensecheck, so
    debian/copyright_hints is now a normal textfile


unittests:
 Q: Upstream seems to ship tests; it would be nice if those were run at build
    time. (But using Debian's cppunit, not the home-grown one in contrib/.)
 A: unfortunately unittests currently only work on w32.
    therefore i took the liberty to exclude all tests from the framework, as
    this reduces the source package size from 30MB to 2.5MB

licenses/DEP5
 Q: DEP-5-enabled lintian (see bug #633779) also reports several issues:
    W: assimp source: missing-field-in-dep5-copyright paragraph 20 copyright
    W: assimp source: comma-separated-files-in-dep5-copyright
    W: assimp source: missing-license-paragraph-in-dep5-copyright paragraph 32 public domain
    W: assimp source: missing-license-paragraph-in-dep5-copyright paragraph 32 free for use however you like credits are appreciated!!!
    W: assimp source: missing-license-paragraph-in-dep5-copyright paragraph 32 reuse allowed for any purpose credits appreciated.
    W: assimp source: missing-license-paragraph-in-dep5-copyright paragraph 32 redistribution 
 A: all those notes are now gone as they are no longer shipped in the debian
    source package

python:
 Q: I think you could drop build-dependency on python-dev.
 A: this is automatically pulled in by cdbs

 Q: I would consider stricter dependency between python-pyassimp and libassimp2.
    (It doesn't matter for the time being, but it might become a problem in the
    future.)
 A: done

 Q: Shared library loading mechanism is utterly broken
 A: fixed

 Q: Also, why did it print stuff on stdout? :/
 A: because upstream did it like that; while fixing the loading mechanism i
    fixed that as well
