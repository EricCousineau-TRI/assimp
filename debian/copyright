License: glut
 The OpenGL Utility Toolkit distribution for Win32 (Windows NT & Windows 95)
 contains source code modified from the original source code for GLUT version 3.3
 which was developed by Mark J. Kilgard.  The original source code for GLUT is
 Copyright 1997 by Mark J. Kilgard.  GLUT for Win32 is Copyright 1997 by Nate
 Robins and is not in the public domain, but it is freely distributable without
 licensing fees.  It is provided without guarantee or warrantee expressed or
 implied.  It was ported with the permission of Mark J. Kilgard by Nate Robins.

 EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR
 MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

License: infozip
 This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or
 implied. In no event shall Info-ZIP or its contributors be held liable for any
 direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of
 the use of or inability to use this software.
 .
 Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose, including
 commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it freely, subject to
 the above disclaimer and the following restrictions:
 .
 Redistributions of source code (in whole or in part) must retain the above
 copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list of conditions.
 .
 Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries) must
 reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list of
 conditions in documentation and/or other materials provided with the
 distribution. Additional documentation is not needed for executables where a
 command line license option provides these and a note regarding this option is
 in the executable's startup banner. The sole exception to this condition is
 redistribution of a standard UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as part of a
 self-extracting archive; that is permitted without inclusion of this license, as
 long as the normal SFX banner has not been removed from the binary or disabled.
 .
 Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating systems,
 existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with modified or added
 functionality, and dynamic, shared, or static library versions not from
 Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not be misrepresented as being
 the original source or, if binaries, compiled from the original source. Such
 altered versions also must not be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP
 releases--including, but not limited to, labeling of the altered versions with
 the names "Info-ZIP" (or any variation thereof, including, but not limited to,
 different capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the
 explicit permission of Info-ZIP. Such altered versions are further prohibited
 from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP e-mail addresses or the
 Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP will provide support for the altered
 versions.
 .
 Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
 "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its own source
 and binary releases..
